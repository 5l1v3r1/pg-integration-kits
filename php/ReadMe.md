# Let's start with php

Download the php folder from the above repository.You can refer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repo) to download a single folder form the repository.

Extract the downloaded zip file and Place it in the root directory of your web server.Let's assume that the root directory is /var/www/html.The directory should look like /var/www/html/php/. 


## Prerequisites

you need have the below requirements running on your system to start working with the php 
integration kit.

```
1)Apache web server
2)Php 7.0

```

## Testing & Integrating 

Lets start by testing our payment gateway, 
You can access the test credentials from merchant dashboard (API access > credentials) [here](https://test.gocashfree.com/merchant/pg#api-key).

**Step 1**

  - Open the file request.php, and update the value of the variable $mode to "TEST"(for testing) or "PROD"(for production) depending on your environment.

  - Update the variable secretKey with the correct value for the mode you have selected

**Step 2**

  - Visit localhost/php/start.php in the browser, fill in the details as required and submit. 

  - Once the payment page opens enter the below card details for testing purpose
  ```
  Card Number : 4111 1111 1111 1111
  CVV : 123
  ```
  You can enter any name,month and year.

**Step 3**

  - Simulate a failed/success transaction (add some lines here about this) and the return URL

[NOTE :](#) In the file request.php, please make sure that you are using the correct integration mode. 

***Start.php***

To test our gateway, run this file on the web server and fill in the required details.Enter the test details on the payment gateway and you will be directed to our payment gateway simulator where you can simulate either a successful or a failed transaction.

***Request.php***

Lets see what's happening in the background. The following code generates a signature from the details given.

```php
$secretKey = "<YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE>";
  $postData = array( 
  "appId" => $appId, 
  "orderId" => $orderId, 
  "orderAmount" => $orderAmount, 
  "orderCurrency" => $orderCurrency, 
  "orderNote" => $orderNote, 
  "customerName" => $customerName, 
  "customerPhone" => $customerPhone, 
  "customerEmail" => $customerEmail,
  "returnUrl" => $returnUrl, 
  "notifyUrl" => $notifyUrl,
);
ksort($postData);
$signatureData = "";
foreach ($postData as $key => $value){
    $signatureData .= $key.$value;
}
$signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $signatureData, $secretKey,true);
$signature = base64_encode($signature);

```
It uses a hidden form to submit the details.If the signature matches with signature generated by us you will be allowed to proceed to the gateway.we will send the transaction details to the returnUrl given.

***Response.php***

Place/Upload this file at the correct location as per the returnUrl.It collects the transaction details and displays them.
